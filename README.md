# Voice activity Detection Using Wavelet Transform

In this paper, we look at 2 different methods
for Voice Activity Detection (VAD) based on the Wavelet
Transform. The algorithms utilize the Wavelet Transformâ€™s
flexibility in the time-frequency resolution to compute
robust parameters for VAD decision. We examine the
performance of the algorithms in clean and various noisy
environments with varying levels of noise

```main.m ```: To run the two algorithms on all the audio signals and generate the comparison plots.<br />
```single_file.m``` : To observe the algorithm in action on a single audio file<br />
```babble.mat factory1.mat white.mat leopard.mat``` : Noise signals
